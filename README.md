\f0\fs24 \cf0 # Gmail Inbox Reordering Extension\
\
A minimal Firefox extension that visually reorders your Gmail inbox by star color, then by timestamp, without breaking Gmail\'92s built-in click handlers.\
\
## Features\
\
1. **Star Color Priority**  \
   - Sorts by star color in the order: None, Purple, Red, Yellow.  \
   - If an email is **unread**, it\'92s treated as though unstarred (None).\
   \
2. **Time-Based Sorting**  \
   - Within each star color group, emails are sorted by the newest (most recent timestamp) first.\
\
3. **Preserves Click Functionality**  \
   - Uses a Flex layout approach to reorder emails **visually**, so clicking a row still opens the correct message.\
\
4. **Lightweight**  \
   - Minimal JavaScript, minimal overhead.\
\
5. **GPT Powered**\
   - Code was written by ChatGPT, not me\
